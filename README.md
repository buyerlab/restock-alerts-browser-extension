# restock-alerts-browser-extension


### Our Goalï¼š
Due to COVID - 19, the current economy's regression has hugely impacted people's daily lives. And this effect is profound. Especially while the production capacity is insufficient, people need help finding an effective way to browse and shop. For example, people won't be able to get an on-time notification while an out-of-stock product is restocked, or people won't be able to choose when to make a purchase. The lack of centralized data and information accessibility from metadata of the marketplace has been a problem for both retailers and customers. 

Restock Alerts is a tool to solve this pain point. It is an app to help users get updated information on the restocked products by sending notifications to users. By registering the message, the user can insert the product's URL and choose the retailer. This great function already exists in mobile and desktop devices, and we are building the website plug-in so desktop shoppers can be more convenient when shopping online.
